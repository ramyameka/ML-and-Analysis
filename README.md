Human Activity Recognition Case Analysis: 

Executed a complete project utilizing a real-world dataset comprising over 10,000 data points, encompassing data assessment, model training, analytical insights, and comprehensive reporting.

The primary goal was to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on provided human activity recognition data sourced from smartwatches.

Subsequently, achieved the secondary objective of generating visual representations and constructing predictive or descriptive models using a minimum of three distinct machine learning algorithms, all based on the collected human activity recognition data from smartwatches.
